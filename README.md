"Keep implementing this list, if it doesn't exist already, in the same way as the old pages, until all finishes. Add them to home page. Don't ask me in between"

Boom!! 💥💥💥💥💥

A curated collection of **100 practical, single-page web tools** built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each tool is designed to solve a specific everyday problem with a clean, intuitive interface.
