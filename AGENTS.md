## Repository summary
GPT Ideas Hub is a static website that hosts a curated catalog of 100+ single-page tools (each a standalone HTML page) built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The homepage (`index.html`) lists tools, supports search/filtering by category, and links to each page. Tool metadata (title, description, category, tags, id) lives in `script.js` in the `pagesData` array; routing to pages is generated by `generatePageFileName()` based on id + title.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Homepage UI and layout.
- `styles.css`: Global design system and shared styles used by all pages.
- `script.js`: Main logic for filtering, search, pagination, pin/favorite, and page metadata (`pagesData`). Categories are mapped to display names in `getCategoryDisplayName()`.
- `pages/`: Individual tool pages. Each file name follows `<id>-<slug>.html` (generated from title).
- `create-page.js`: Node script that scaffolds a new page template and suggests adding metadata to `script.js`.
- Assets: icons, `site.webmanifest`, `CNAME`, `gpt-pages.png`.

## Page conventions
Individual tool pages are standalone HTML files with these patterns:
- Standard head includes Google Analytics script, `styles.css`, Google Fonts (Inter + Space Grotesk), and Font Awesome.
- Inline `<style>` block for page-specific layout while reusing shared CSS variables (`--gradient-primary`, `--border-radius`, etc.).
- `body` uses `class="individual-page"`.
- A fixed "Back to Hub" button links to `../index.html`.
- A hero-style page header with title emoji, category badge, and page number.
- Main content in `.content-section` blocks, usually with an input area and a results area.

## Categories
Homepage filter tabs are defined in `index.html`. Valid categories currently used include:
`personal`, `finance`, `health`, `education`, `creative`, `travel`, `productivity`, `lifestyle`, `entertainment`, `tech`, `music`.

## Adding a new page
1. Create the HTML file in `pages/` using existing pages as templates.
2. Use the next numeric id and a slugified title for the filename.
3. Add a matching entry in `pagesData` in `script.js`.
4. Ensure the category matches the filter tabs and `getCategoryDisplayName()` mapping.

## Recently added/modified tool
- `pages/103-salary-per-second-counter.html`: Salary per-second counter with a live accumulator; salary input hides after entry; live earnings values are masked by default and toggle reveal on click.
- `script.js`: Added the page entry (id 103) to `pagesData`.

## Style notes
- Design uses CSS variables from `styles.css` for colors, shadows, gradients, and spacing.
- Buttons use `.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary` styling.
- Layout often uses two-column grids that collapse to single-column on mobile (`@media (max-width: 768px)`).
- Keep copy concise and utility-focused; include small helper hints when behavior is non-obvious.
